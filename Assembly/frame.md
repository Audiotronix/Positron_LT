### Required Tools:

- Makerbeam L-Brackets
- Makerbeam T-Nuts

## Main-Beam

### Layout

1. Take the 240mm beams and one 250mm beam and place them next to eachother. The 250mm beam should be in the middle. **The threads in the beams should be in the front.**
2. Take a L-Bracket and screw it onto the front.
3. Take some more L-Brackets and screw them onto the main-beam using the T-Nuts so that the 3 makerbeams are beeing held firmly together. These extra Brackets should be on the oposing side the front L is pointing.

### Drilling

- Place two L-Brackets on each Side at the back of the main-beam.
- Screw them tight with 2 screws leaving the hole in the back.

1. Drill on one side trough the first beam with a 3mm drill. Do the same on the other side but with a 2.5mm drill.
2. Drill trough the side where you just drilled the 3mm hole a 2.5mm hole into the beam in the middle. Tap the 2.5mm hole on the other side.
3. Tap the 2.5mm hole in the middle beam trough the 3mm hole.
4. Fasten a 18mm m3 screw in the long hole and a 10mm m3 screw in the short hole.
5. Unscrew on both sides the middle screw holding the L-Bracket (move the T-Nut tot he side). Drill a 2.5mm hole on the side of the long m3 screw. And a 3mm hole on the other side.
6. Tap the 2.5mm hole and drill a 2.5mm hole trough the hole on the other side into the middle beam.
7. Tap the 2.5mm hole in the middle beam trough the 3mm hole.

> You can use a T-Nut if you messed the tap up. The nut needs to be placed in the middle beam. This technique is not recommended but might save your day.
