# Frame assembly

### Required Tools:
- M3 Hex Key driver
- Drill
- M2.5 Drill bit (2mm might also work)
- M3 Drill bit
- M3 Tap
- M6 Tap

> A tap is recommended, threading with a screw might also work, but the screw can easily break off!

### Required Materials:
- 240mm Makerbeam x2
- 250mm Makerbeam x3
- 230mm Makerbeam x1
- Makerbeam L-Brackets
- Makerbeam T-Nuts
- Makerbeam Cubes
- m3 10mm screw x2
- m3 20mm screw x2

## Main-Beam

### Layout

1. Take the 240mm beams and one 250mm beam and place them next to eachother. The 250mm beam should be in the middle. **The threads in the beams should be in the front.**
2. Take a L-Bracket and screw it onto the front.
3. Take some more L-Brackets and screw them onto the main-beam using the T-Nuts so that the 3 makerbeams are beeing held firmly together. These extra Brackets should be on the oposing side the front L is pointing.

</div>

### Drilling

- Place two L-Brackets on each Side at the back of the main-beam.
- Screw them tight with 2 screws.

</div>
  
1. On the first side remove the screw (and T-Nut) that's on the right side and drill a 2.5mm wide hole trough the outer and the center beam.
2. Now cut a M3 Thread trough the just drilled hole with a tap into both beams.
3. Drill the just cut thread in the outer beam to a 3mm wide hole.
4. Insert a 20mm M3 flathead screw.
5. Remove the left screw (and T-Nut) and drill a 2.5mm wide hole into the outer beam only.
6. Cut a M3 Thread into the just drilled hole.
7. Insert a 10mm M3 flathead screw.
8. On the other side, remove the screw (and T-Nut) that sits at the same height as the 20mm screw on the opposite site and drill a 2.5mm wide hole into the outer beam.
9. Now cut a M3 thread into the previous drilled hole.
10. Insert a 10mm M3 flathead screw
11. Remove the screw (and T-Nut) that sit's next to the just inserted screw and drill a 2.5mm wide hole into the outer and center beamm.
12. Cut a M3 thread into the just drilled hole all the way trough the center beam.
13. Drill the just cut thread in the outer beam to a 3mm wide hole.
14. Insert a 20mm M3 flathead screw.

  This should result in holes that allow screws to be placed like this:

> You can use a T-Nut if you messed the tap up. The nut needs to be placed in the middle beam. This technique is not recommended but might save your day.

### 30mm Cross-Beam

- The 30mm beam should already have both ends threaded.

1. Screw a L-Bracket onto the 30mm beam and fasten it with 2 screws and nuts on the outer holes.
2. Drill with a 3mm drill trough the middle hole trough the whole beam.
3. Rotate the beam and repeat both previous steps.
4. The result should be a 30mm beam with holes on all 4 sides.

</div>

- Place the 30mm beam between the two L-Brackets and fasten it with 2 screws that came with the brackets.

</div>

### Cube

- Now use a M6 Drill & Tap to drill trough a Makerbeam-Cube

<div align="center">

  [I'm using a combo tap]
  
  To perfectly align everything, stick the tap trough one of the big holes and cut the thread on the opposite side (red circle)
</div>

- Now use a T-Nut to fasten the cube under the 30mm Cross-Beam

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35639879/227797804-b2a6004b-e61e-4c5b-a6f9-919c81439db4.jpg" height="400">
  
  To properly align the cube in the center, you can use 2 spare cubes.

</div>

- Use a flathead screw that came with the Makerbeam L-Brackets to fasten the cube to the beam.
- Stick the allen key trough the previous drilled hole in the cross-beam to properly tighten.

> You can now check all screws that hold the L-Brackets and the cube and retighten them.

> If the two spare cubes below the cross-bar are stuck, then you might have to use [.2mm washers](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005002046188859.html) between the cross-beam and the L-Brackets. If that doesn't improve anything, then you might have to use them also between the L-Brackets and the main-beam

## Z-Tower

### Layout

- Take the 2 250mm beams and the 230mm beam and place them next to eachother.
- Just like with the main beam, use some L-Brackets to hold them together (you might have to remove some from the main-beam)

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35639879/227799618-0c233b28-84bc-4700-b2c5-2423f761dd2d.png" width="800">
  
  [The blue side should be the side with pre cut threads by makerbeam]
</div>


### Drilling

- Place two L-Brackets on each Side at the top of the Z-Tower.
- Screw them tight with 2 screws

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35639879/227801208-3e36f5cd-c378-49e1-88fe-bc55a675ace8.jpg" width="800">
</div>

1. Remove the middle screw (and T-Nut) on the first side and drill a 2.5mm wide hole trough the outer and center beam
2. Use a M3 Tap and cut the threads trough the just drilled hole into both beams.
3. Drill a 3mm wide hole in the outer beam trough the previous cut thread.
4. Insert a 20mm M3 flathead screw
5. Remove the screw (and T-Nut) to the right of the just inserted screw and drill a 2.5mm wide hole into the outer beam.
6. Cut M3 threads into the just thrilled hole.
7. Inser a 10mm M3 flathead screw.
8. On the opposite side, remove the screw (and T-Nut) that sits on the same heigh as the just inserted 10mm screw and drill a 2.5mm wide hole into the outer and center beam.
9. Cut M3 threads into the just drilled hole.
10. Drill the just cut threads in the outer beam to a 3mm whide hole.
11. Inser a 20mm M3 flathead screw.

</div>

### Top-Cover

- Now unscrew the L-Bracket at the side of the T-Tower
- Place the first printed part `Z-AXIS-ENDSTOP` on the top trough
- Fasten it with 1 m3x14mm and 2 m3x25mm screws

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35639879/227803101-463a8bfc-4736-4820-93a4-f604ccf5f8a6.jpg" width="800">
</div>

- Now Remove all L-Brackets that are holding the Z-Tower together and only place one on the back of the tower near the bottom

### Cubes

- Take a 6mm drill and drill trough the whole cube (red circle)

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35639879/227804811-0f2a890d-4be5-4e49-ad67-e544be271cea.png" width="400">
</div>

- Now screw the cube with a flathead screw that came with the L-Brackets onto the bottom of the Z-Tower

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35639879/227804935-df8be731-fcc3-4b5d-a0be-90bde5a80cc8.jpg" width="400">
</div>

- Now take 2 cubes and place them on the two outer beams of the Z-Tower.
- Loosely fasten them to the beams using T-Nuts and flathead screws.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35639879/227805182-97ee8250-2e94-41bc-af2c-c5c28cbb753a.jpg" width="800">
</div>

### Complete frame assembly

- Take the main-beam and the Z-Tower and put them together.
- The two cubes of the Z-Tower should slot below the 30mm cross-bar.
- If they do not fit, then you might have to use [.2mm washers](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005002046188859.html) between the cross-beam and the L-Brackets. If that doesn't improve anything, then you might have to use them also between the L-Brackets and the main-beam

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35639879/227805372-79ac1fa6-708c-4717-acdb-6ad6997c0e22.jpg" width="800">
</div>

- Make sure that there is no gap between the Z-Tower and the cross-bar.
- Everything should sit completely flush.
- If there are some gaps then loosen the cross-bar and the center cube and push everything firmly together.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35639879/227805786-039e9a19-8703-4311-8d9b-1e33fdd24900.jpg" width="800">
</div>

- You can now use the thumbscrew to hold everything together.
- I like to loosen every screw of the hinge, tighten the thumbscrew and then tighten every screw so that every screw now has it's final position.

This concludes the assembly of the frame.
