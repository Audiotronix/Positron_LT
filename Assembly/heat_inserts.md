## Inserting

>[Here](https://www.cnckitchen.com/blog/tipps-amp-tricks-fr-gewindeeinstze-im-3d-druck-3awey) you can find instructions on how to insert the inserts.

We recommend to follow these steps:

- Use a circular nozzle tip on the soldering iron. Nothing angled, square or similar.
- You can also use a special heat insert nozzle tip like [you can find some here](https://amzn.eu/d/bV6uYo2)
- Heat the soldering iron up to a temperature where the insert starts to slowly slide into the printed part
- Push it a bit further into the part so that a screw can be screwed into it flush
- Hold the insert with the plier so that it does not come out when pulling the soldering iron
- If the insert did move on removal, push it further in with the plier while it's still hot

> Do not touch the insert! It's very hot!

> You need to be pretty fast with inserting the heat insert, otherwise the printed part will start to deform
